# Objective Delimitation

Our primary objective is to create an advanced, AI-powered knowledge management system that enhances internal knowledge utilization specifically within Brazil’s legal sector. Rather than managing or replacing existing document storage solutions, our platform is designed to integrate intelligently with a firm’s current repositories, including common systems like Google Drive, OneDrive, iManage, and SharePoint. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, we establish seamless access to logical connections between internal precedents, templates, and other legal documents and external sources (Brazilian laws, regulations, and jurisprudence).

The platform itself does not aim to solve file storage or digitalization problems. Instead, it enhances the practical use of existing stored knowledge by establishing intelligent retrieval, synthesis, and contextual reuse of documents. The primary goal is to create meaningful, actionable knowledge from files that otherwise remain underutilized, empowering legal professionals in Brazil to achieve higher productivity, greater consistency, and improved legal outcomes.
