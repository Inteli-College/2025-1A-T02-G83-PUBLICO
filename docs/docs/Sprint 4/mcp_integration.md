# Model Context Protocol Integration

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to safely access external tools and information sources. It provides a structured way for AI models to interact with a variety of data sources, execute commands, and access specialized functionality beyond their training data.

Key capabilities of MCP include:
- Standardized communication between AI models and external tools
- Secure access to resources and capabilities
- Extensible architecture for custom tool development
- Cross-platform compatibility across different AI providers

## Our MCP Strategy

Lexun's strategy for MCP integration focuses on creating a set of specialized servers that extend the capabilities of our platform by enabling AI models to:

1. Access document repositories through vector search
2. Interact with our backend services and databases
3. Perform specialized functions unique to our application domain
4. Maintain consistency across different AI provider ecosystems

## ChromaDB-MCP Implementation

As a proof of concept, we've developed an MCP server that integrates ChromaDB for semantic search capabilities. This server demonstrates how we can expose vector database functionality to AI models through the MCP standard.

### Architecture

The ChromaDB-MCP server follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
src/
├── configs/         # Configuration settings
├── infra/           # Infrastructure implementations
├── ports/           # Interface definitions
├── tools/           # MCP tool implementations
├── dependency_manager.py # Dependency injection container
└── server.py        # MCP server implementation
```

### Key Components

1. **MCP Server** - Built using the FastMCP framework to expose tools to AI models
2. **Vector Store** - ChromaDB integration for document storage and retrieval
3. **Document Processing** - Systems for ingesting, chunking, and embedding documents
4. **Dependency Injection** - Container for managing service dependencies

### Current Functionality

The current implementation exposes a key tool to AI models:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_similar_chunks(query: str, k: int = 2) -> str:
    """
    Retrieve chunks similar to the input query using the configured vector store.

    Args:
        query: The input text to find similar chunks for
        k: The number of chunks to retrieve

    Returns:
        A JSON containing the chunks and their metadata, or "No results were found" if no chunks found
    """
    return tools.retrieve_similar_chunks(query, k)
```

This tool allows AI models to perform semantic searches across our document repository, finding text chunks that are conceptually similar to a given query.

## Integration with AI Assistants

The ChromaDB-MCP server can be integrated with AI assistants like Claude through their desktop applications. Configuration typically involves:

1. Specifying the server location and launch parameters
2. Setting environment variables for authentication and resource paths
3. Configuring the assistant to recognize and utilize the MCP server's tools

Example Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "chromadb": {
         "command": "/path/to/bin/uv",
         "args": [
         "--directory",
         "/path/to/chromadb-mcp",
         "run",
         "main.py"
         ],
         "env": {
            "INPUT_DIR": "/path/to/files",
            "CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY": "/path/to/chroma_db",
            "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## Future MCP Expansion

Our roadmap for expanding MCP capabilities includes:

### Additional MCP Servers

1. **Database MCP Server** - For querying relational databases and accessing structured data
2. **Analytics MCP Server** - For performing data analysis and visualization
3. **Workflow MCP Server** - For triggering and monitoring business processes

### Enhanced Functionality

1. **Bidirectional Communication** - Allow AI models to not only retrieve data but also update it when appropriate
2. **Multi-modal Support** - Extend beyond text to support image, audio, and other data types
3. **Advanced Permissioning** - Fine-grained access control for different AI models and users

### Integration Points

1. **Frontend Integration** - Direct MCP connections from our web application 
2. **Backend API Gateway** - Centralized MCP management through our API infrastructure
3. **Custom AI Models** - Developing our own fine-tuned models with MCP capabilities

## Benefits of MCP Approach

Our MCP integration strategy provides several key advantages:

1. **Extensibility** - Easy addition of new tools and capabilities without modifying core AI models
2. **Interoperability** - Works across different AI providers and platforms
3. **Security** - Controlled access to resources with proper authentication and authorization
4. **Specialization** - Custom tools that address our specific domain requirements
5. **Future-proofing** - Adaptability to evolving AI model architectures and capabilities

## Challenges and Considerations

As we expand our MCP implementation, we're addressing several challenges:

1. **Performance Optimization** - Ensuring low-latency responses for real-time applications
2. **Security Boundaries** - Carefully defining what capabilities to expose to AI models
3. **Error Handling** - Graceful management of failures in MCP tool execution
4. **Versioning** - Maintaining compatibility as tools evolve over time
5. **Monitoring** - Tracking usage patterns and detecting anomalies
