# 🧭 Strategic Wrap‑Up — Company Direction

This memo wraps up what we built and learned over the last months and clarifies where we’re focusing next. Short version: our strongest product–market fit and business model are with institutional customers — large Brazilian companies operating in highly competitive categories (beauty, fashion, retail/e‑commerce, fintech, food delivery, wellness). Our recent feature work (Workspaces, Nested Boards, AI capabilities, and the Browser Extension) positions Magic Mango as a professional, team‑ready platform that can mirror enterprise structures and deliver measurable creative performance.

---

## Executive Summary

- We validated that the highest‑value problems live inside teams, not solo creators. Institutional teams need structure, governance, and speed across many campaigns and brands.
- Product has evolved from a single‑player research tool into a collaborative workspace:
  - Workspaces (in active development) → team accounts, shared assets, and centralized administration.
  - Nested Boards → hierarchical organization that reflects real campaign and brand structures.
  - AI Features → searchable intelligence, contextual assistance, and faster iteration cycles.
  - Browser Extension → the bridge from external ad libraries into our organized workflow.
- Business model aligns with institutional customers: per‑seat, per‑workspace with room for usage‑based AI add‑ons.

## Vision and Mission (Updated)

### Vision

- A market where every creative decision is based on certainty, not opinion.
- A world where an ad’s performance is a science, not an accident.

### Mission

- To decode the connection between brands and people, turning creativity into certainty.

These statements set the north star for Magic Mango: transform creative work from intuition‑heavy to evidence‑based, repeatable, and scalable inside teams.

## Product Progress

### 1) Workspaces — Collaboration and Governance (in active development)

- Shifts ownership from individuals to teams; assets live with the company, not the person.
- Centralized billing and seat management (admin‑controlled); foundation for enterprise contracts.
- Establishes the path to RBAC, SSO, and audit requirements common in large organizations.

### 2) Nested Boards — Enterprise‑Grade Organization

- Multi‑level structure to represent Macro Topics and granular sub‑boards.
- Mirrors how creative work happens: campaigns → moments → experiments.
- Collapsible groups keep navigation clean across large portfolios.

### 3) AI Features — Intelligence in the Workflow

- Automatic transcription, summaries, and semantic search for video and visual assets.
- Contextual assistant that understands the current screen, boards, and projects.
- Actionable help: organize boards, surface similar ads, and generate strategic recommendations.

### 4) Browser Extension — Capture to Structure

- One‑click saving from ad libraries to bring inspiration directly into the workspace.
- Eliminates screenshots and broken links; every asset enters the same organized system.

## Key Learnings From The Last Months

- Creative quality drives performance, but enterprise teams lack a single source of truth across brands and campaigns.
- Flat lists of boards don’t scale beyond a handful of campaigns; hierarchy is essential to preserve context.
- Teams need collaboration primitives (ownership, permissions, shared assets) before advanced analytics can create value.
- The fastest path to adoption is capturing what teams already do (save ads, organize ideas) and upgrading it with AI.
- Corporations want to systematically repeat what works in their own campaigns; bringing performance data next to creative context is critical for repeatability.

## Why Institutional Clients

1. High creative velocity and constant competitive pressure → clear ROI from faster iteration and better organization.
2. Multiple brands, markets, and stakeholders → need for governance (workspaces) and taxonomy (nested boards).
3. Larger budgets and defined procurement → supports per‑seat pricing with predictable expansion as teams grow.
4. Clear success criteria → easier to prove impact via throughput, time‑to‑creative, and performance deltas.
5. Strong reference value → wins in these categories create credibility across the market.

## How Our Current Product Maps To Enterprise Needs

- Structure: Workspaces and Nested Boards let companies reproduce their org model (brands, categories, squads, campaigns) inside Magic Mango.
- Speed: Browser Extension + AI processing turns external discovery into organized, searchable intelligence.
- Collaboration: Shared boards and centralized ownership eliminate asset loss when people change roles.
- Insight: AI assistant and semantic search reduce the time to find patterns and brief new creatives.

---

## Looking Ahead — Closed‑Loop Creative Intelligence (Vision)

Corporations want to reliably repeat what works. Our forward direction is to connect the dots between creative assets and actual performance so teams can systematize winners and learn faster. This is a vision, not a committed roadmap.

- Integrations with paid‑traffic platforms ("tráfego pago") such as Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, and Google/YouTube Ads to ingest performance signals alongside the creative artifacts.
- Unified mapping between assets and metrics (spend, CTR, CPA/ROAS, creative fatigue) to enable pattern detection inside boards and across Macro Topics.
- “Repeatable winners” workflows: identify top performers, suggest variants, and help teams redeploy proven angles across markets and formats with guardrails.
- Privacy‑first principles: least‑privilege connectors, clear data boundaries, and export controls suited for institutional compliance.

Again: these are exploratory directions that guide product thinking; timelines and commitments are intentionally out of scope for this wrap‑up.

## Conclusion

Over the past months, we transformed Magic Mango into a professional, team‑ready platform. Workspaces, Nested Boards, AI assistance, and the Browser Extension give institutional customers a clear operating model for creative strategy: one workspace, shared truth, faster iterations, and measurable performance. Our forward‑looking vision is to close the loop with performance data so enterprises can repeatedly scale what works—turning creativity into certainty.
