# 🔌 Browser Extension

During our customer interviews and market research, we identified a critical need for a seamless way for users to bring into Magic Mango their favorite ads. This insight led to the development of the Magic Mango Browser Extension.

## The Need

Marketing teams and creative strategists spend significant time browsing ad libraries and social media platforms to discover inspiring and effective ad creatives. However, the process of saving and organizing these ads was often cumbersome:

- Manual screenshots and downloads were time-consuming
- No direct integration with creative management tools
- Difficulty in organizing saved ads effectively
- Lost context when saving ads from different platforms

## Presenting the Magic Mango Browser Extension
