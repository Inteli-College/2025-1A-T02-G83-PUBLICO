# 🗂️ Nested Boards

Nested Boards introduce multi-level organization to Magic Mango. Create high-level Macro Topics and break them down into sub-boards as needed. This mirrors how creative teams actually plan and execute campaigns—clear strategy at the top, granular work streams underneath.

## The challenge we’re solving

Marketing teams told us that single-level boards quickly become cluttered and hard to navigate as campaigns scale. Common pain points:

- One long, flat board list mixes seasons, product pillars, and experiments.
- Teams duplicate boards to simulate structure, fragmenting assets and context.
- Research, ideation, and production artifacts drift apart across boards.
- New collaborators struggle to find “where things live.”

## What Nested Boards enable

- Macro Topics at the top (e.g., “End of Year Campaigns”), with sub-boards like “Black Friday” and “Christmas”.
- Collapsible groups that keep navigation clean while retaining hierarchy.
- Flexible depth so teams can go granular only where it adds value.
- Clear organization that scales without breaking existing workflows.

*A quick tour of creating parent boards and nesting sub-boards.*

## How it works

- Any board can act as a parent. Add children via the `+` next to a board or drag-and-drop to nest.
- Collapse/expand to focus your view; parents remember their state.
- Reorder parents and children to reflect current priorities.
- Nothing changes about access: existing workspace/board visibility rules continue to apply.

### Quick start
1. Create a Macro Topic (e.g., “End of Year Campaign”).
2. Click the `+` beside it to add sub-boards like “Black Friday” and “Christmas”.
3. Drag any existing board under a parent to re-parent it.
4. Collapse groups to keep your sidebar tidy.

## Business impact

- Faster retrieval: Teams find the right creative context in seconds.
- Less duplication: A single source of truth for campaigns and experiments.
- Better collaboration: Shared mental model of how work is organized.
- Scalable governance: Structure grows with the team, not against it.

## Common structures

- Seasonal campaigns → Quarter/Season → Moments (e.g., Summer → Launch → Variations)
- Competitive monitoring → Competitors → Brands → Formats
- Product pillars → Collections → Angles → Tests

## Best practices

- Start broad, then go deep only where the volume warrants it.
- Name Macro Topics with nouns (e.g., “Wellness”) and sub-boards with actions or scopes (e.g., “Hooks to Test”).
- Review structure monthly; archive or merge when a campaign ends.
- Keep a “Sandbox” sub-board for rapid experiments that later graduate.

## Notes

- Search and navigation work across parent and child boards, so you can find creatives regardless of depth.
- Moving a board preserves its contents and metadata.

---

## Roadmap

- Rollups: parent-level summaries of activity across children.
- Templates: create a Macro Topic with a pre-made set of sub-boards.
- Bulk actions: move/archive multiple sub-boards at once.

Nested Boards help teams organize the creative process with the right level of granularity—clear at the top, precise where needed.
