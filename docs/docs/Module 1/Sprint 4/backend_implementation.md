# Backend Implementation

## Architecture Overview

The Lexun backend is built using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. The architecture follows clean design principles to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

### Key Technologies

- **FastAPI**: Core framework for building the API endpoints
- **Python 3.12+**: Modern Python version for the latest language features
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and ORM for database operations
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for semantic search capabilities
- **Langchain**: Framework for building applications with language models
- **OpenAI and Google Generative AI**: AI providers for language model capabilities
- **Smolagents**: For building lightweight AI agents
- **Asyncpg**: High-performance PostgreSQL client library
- **OpenInference**: For AI observability and telemetry

## Directory Structure

The backend follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── core/           # Core application logic and domain models
├── config/         # Configuration settings and initialization
├── events/         # Event handling and messaging
├── infrastructure/ # External services integrations and repositories
│   └── api/        # API endpoints and route definitions
├── sse_broker/     # Server-Sent Events implementation
└── main.py         # Application entry point
```

## Key Features

### API Endpoints

The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for:

- User authentication and management
- Data retrieval and manipulation
- AI processing and analysis
- Real-time event streaming

### AI Integration

The backend includes robust integration with AI services:

- Multiple AI provider support (OpenAI, Google AI)
- Langchain for complex AI workflows
- Smolagents for lightweight, specialized AI agents
- Vector database integration for semantic search

### Real-time Capabilities

Our backend supports real-time features through:

- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for push notifications
- Event-driven architecture for responsive updates
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations

## Implementation Highlights

### Clean Architecture

We've implemented clean architecture principles to separate concerns:

- Domain models and business logic isolated from infrastructure
- Dependency injection for modular components
- Repository pattern for data access abstraction

### Database Integration

The backend connects to PostgreSQL for relational data storage:

- SQLAlchemy for ORM capabilities
- Asyncpg for high-performance database operations
- Migration system for database schema evolution

### Vector Database

For semantic search and similarity matching, we've integrated ChromaDB:

- Document embedding and storage
- Semantic similarity search
- Integration with AI model embeddings

### Observability

We've implemented comprehensive logging and monitoring:

- Structured logging with contextual information
- OpenInference for AI operation telemetry
- Phoenix integration for OpenTelemetry support

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: AI Model Management

**Problem**: Managing interactions with multiple AI providers and models while maintaining consistency.

**Solution**: Implemented an abstraction layer with Langchain that standardizes interactions across different AI providers.

### Challenge: Asynchronous Processing

**Problem**: Handling long-running AI tasks without blocking API responses.

**Solution**: Implemented asynchronous processing with background tasks and event-driven architecture.

## Future Improvements

For future sprints, we're planning several enhancements to the backend:

1. Enhanced caching strategy for improved performance
2. Horizontal scaling capabilities for handling increased load
3. More sophisticated AI orchestration with complex workflows
4. Enhanced security features including role-based access control
5. Deeper integration with vector databases for advanced semantic search
6. MCP server implementation for extensible AI tool capabilities
