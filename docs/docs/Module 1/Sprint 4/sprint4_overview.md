# Demo Development Overview

## Introduction

Sprint 4 focused on developing a functional demonstration of the Lexun platform, showcasing our core capabilities while establishing a foundation for future development. This sprint represents a significant milestone in our project's evolution, as we've moved from conceptual planning to practical implementation.

## Key Objectives

- Develop a working frontend demonstration with intuitive user interface
- Implement backend functionality to support core features
- Establish a solid architecture for future expansion
- Explore integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced AI capabilities
- Create a seamless user experience that highlights our value proposition

## Sprint Achievements

- Successfully built a responsive frontend using Next.js and modern UI components
- Implemented backend services with FastAPI to handle data processing and AI interactions
- Established the groundwork for MCP integration with a ChromaDB prototype
- Created a cohesive user experience that demonstrates the platform's potential
- Documented the architecture, implementation details, and future roadmap

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into several sections:

1. **Frontend Implementation** - Details of the user interface, components, and user experience
2. **Backend Services** - Overview of the server architecture, API endpoints, and data processing
3. **MCP Integration** - Exploration of Model Context Protocol integration and vector database capabilities
4. **Future Roadmap** - Planned improvements and feature expansions for upcoming sprints

Each section provides insights into our implementation decisions, technical architecture, and development approach. This documentation serves as both a record of Sprint 4's achievements and a guide for future development efforts.
