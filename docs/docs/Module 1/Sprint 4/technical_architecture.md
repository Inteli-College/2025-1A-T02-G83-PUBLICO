# Technical Architecture

## System Overview

The Lexun platform is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed to support AI-powered knowledge management and interaction. The system consists of three primary components:

1. **Frontend Application** - A responsive Next.js web application providing the user interface
2. **Backend Services** - FastAPI-powered microservices handling data processing and AI orchestration
3. **MCP Servers** - Specialized servers providing AI models with access to tools and data sources

## Component Details

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built as a Next.js application with a component-based architecture:

- **App Router** - Next.js 14 app directory structure for routing
- **Server Components** - For improved performance and SEO
- **Client Components** - For interactive elements requiring client-side state
- **Shared Components** - Reusable UI elements built on Radix UI and Tailwind

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a clean architecture approach:

- **API Layer** - FastAPI endpoints for handling HTTP requests
- **Service Layer** - Business logic and orchestration
- **Repository Layer** - Data access abstraction
- **Domain Layer** - Core business entities and rules

### Data Architecture

Our data architecture includes multiple storage systems:

- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for structured data
- **ChromaDB** - Vector database for semantic search
- **File Storage** - For document and media storage

### AI Integration Architecture

AI capabilities are integrated through multiple approaches:

- **Direct API Integration** - For OpenAI and Google AI services
- **Langchain Framework** - For complex AI workflows
- **MCP Servers** - For specialized tool access by AI models
- **Embedding Pipeline** - For converting documents to vector representations

## Communication Patterns

### Frontend-Backend Communication

- RESTful API calls for data operations
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- WebSockets for bidirectional communication (planned)

### Backend-AI Communication

- Asynchronous API calls to AI providers
- Streaming responses for progressive UI updates
- MCP standard for tool-based interactions

### MCP Communication

The Model Context Protocol enables standardized interaction patterns:

- Tool registration and discovery
- Method invocation with structured parameters
- Resource access with proper authentication
- Error handling and status reporting

## Deployment Architecture

Our deployment strategy leverages modern cloud-native approaches:

- **Containerization** - Docker for consistent environments
- **Orchestration** - Kubernetes for scaling and management (planned)
- **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated testing and deployment
- **Environment Isolation** - Development, staging, and production environments

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented across multiple layers:

- **Authentication** - Identity verification for users and services
- **Authorization** - Permission-based access control
- **Data Protection** - Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation** - Protection against injection attacks
- **MCP Security** - Controlled access to tools and resources

## Observability Architecture

To maintain system health and performance, we implement:

- **Logging** - Structured logging with contextual information
- **Monitoring** - Performance and health metrics collection
- **Tracing** - Distributed tracing for request flows
- **Alerting** - Automated notifications for system issues
- **AI Telemetry** - Tracking of AI model usage and performance

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed for horizontal scalability:

- **Stateless Services** - Enabling easy replication of backend services
- **Database Scaling** - Strategies for database growth
- **Caching** - Multi-level caching for performance optimization
- **Load Balancing** - Distribution of traffic across service instances

## Future Architecture Evolution

As the system grows, we plan to evolve the architecture in several ways:

1. **Microservices Decomposition** - Further breaking down services by domain
2. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Expanding use of events for loose coupling
3. **Edge Computing** - Moving select processing closer to users
4. **Multi-Region Deployment** - Geographic distribution for improved latency
5. **Enhanced MCP Ecosystem** - More specialized MCP servers for diverse capabilities
