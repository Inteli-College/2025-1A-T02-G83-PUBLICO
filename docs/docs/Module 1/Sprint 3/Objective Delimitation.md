# Objective Delimitation

Our primary objective is to develop an advanced, AI-powered knowledge management platform tailored specifically for the legal sector. Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, our solution aims to significantly enhance the utilization of existing legal knowledge by intelligently connecting internal documents—such as precedents, templates, and historical records—to relevant external sources, including Brazilian laws, regulations, and jurisprudence.

The platform is not intended to address issues related to file storage, digitization, or archiving. Instead, it focuses exclusively on maximizing the practical value of a firm's existing document repositories and knowledge assets. By creating seamless, context-aware integration between internal resources (precedents, templates, case documents) and external legal references (Brazilian legislation, jurisprudence), our solution ensures legal professionals can efficiently retrieve relevant, accurate, and interconnected information.

Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, our platform empowers legal professionals to rapidly generate high-quality, consistent documents by automatically identifying and applying relevant internal precedents and external legal sources. Ultimately, this leads to enhanced efficiency, improved quality and consistency in legal documentation, and stronger strategic decision-making across legal teams.
