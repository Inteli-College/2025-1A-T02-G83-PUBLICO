# Project Limitations

While Lexun presents significant innovation potential by integrating advanced AI technology into legal knowledge management, certain limitations—both technical and legal—need to be recognized and addressed to ensure successful development and adoption of the platform.

⸻

## Technical Limitations and Barriers

One primary technical challenge is dealing with the unstructured and often inconsistent nature of legal documentation. Law firms typically possess vast collections of documents—ranging from scanned legacy contracts and older PDFs without digital text layers (OCR issues), to disorganized archives stored across multiple services like Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, or specialized Document Management Systems (DMS) such as iManage.

To effectively implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Lexun must accurately index and semantically understand these documents. This requires:
	•	Efficient OCR Processing:
Many firms still store scanned PDF documents without proper OCR indexing, hindering semantic search. Lexun will likely rely on high-quality OCR processing, yet even the best OCR can introduce errors, affecting the accuracy of retrieval and results. Continuous investments in refining OCR performance and accuracy verification tools will be critical.
	•	Disparate and Unstructured Data Sources:
Law firms frequently lack consistent naming conventions, folder structures, or metadata standards, complicating automated indexing and retrieval. To address this, Lexun may require custom preprocessing or the adoption of minimal standardization from client-side data before successful integration. This process introduces complexity, requiring collaboration and education efforts to onboard clients effectively.

Limitations in AI and RAG implementation:
	•	Contextual Accuracy and “Chunking” Problem:
The RAG approach involves segmenting (chunking) large documents into smaller pieces to store and retrieve contextually relevant information effectively. However, splitting documents incorrectly can result in loss of essential context or relevance. Thus, determining optimal chunk sizes and overlap parameters is a technical challenge that impacts accuracy and retrieval precision.
	•	Vector Database Performance and Costs:
Storing embeddings for large document repositories requires efficient and cost-effective vector databases. As databases scale, queries might experience latency or increased operational costs, potentially impacting Lexun’s responsiveness or profitability. Balancing speed, cost, and scalability will require careful architectural planning and continuous optimization.
	•	AI Model Limitations (“Hallucinations”):
Despite sophisticated RAG implementations, AI-generated outputs occasionally suffer from “hallucinations”—providing inaccurate or incorrect references. While RAG substantially reduces this risk, it does not entirely eliminate it. Consequently, Lexun will require mechanisms for human verification, transparent referencing of sources, and ongoing monitoring of generated outputs to uphold trust and reliability in legal advice.
	•	Integration Complexity and Compatibility:
Different law firms rely on diverse technology stacks. Integration with existing DMS (iManage, SharePoint, Projuris, SAJ ADV) involves considerable technical effort, compatibility tests, and possibly custom API connectors. Larger firms in particular might demand on-premises or hybrid-cloud solutions due to strict confidentiality policies, adding complexity to deployment and scalability.

## Legal and Regulatory Limitations

Beyond technical challenges, legal constraints significantly influence Lexun’s development and operational processes. Given its focus on sensitive legal documents and internal firm knowledge, Lexun must navigate specific regulatory and ethical obligations in Brazil’s legal environment:
	•	Confidentiality and Legal Privilege:
Legal documents frequently contain highly sensitive information protected under attorney-client privilege or professional secrecy obligations established by Brazil’s Bar Association (OAB). Lexun must implement rigorous controls to ensure no unauthorized disclosure or data leakage occurs. Breaches can result in legal liabilities, reputation damage, and severe penalties, including fines or professional sanctions.
	•	Compliance with LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados):
As a fundamental legal constraint, LGPD requires stringent handling of personal data contained within legal documents (client data, identification numbers, financial details). Lexun will require clear privacy policies, explicit consent for data processing, robust encryption, anonymization measures (when applicable), and strict data access controls to meet compliance obligations. Non-compliance can result in significant fines, legal penalties, and reputational harm.
	•	Potential Conflict of Interest:
Law firms frequently represent clients that might have opposing interests. Lexun’s technology, by integrating data from various law firms, must strictly isolate clients’ datasets to prevent any risk of cross-contamination or inadvertent exposure of sensitive competitive insights. Technical and legal mechanisms (such as data segregation and multi-tenancy architecture) must ensure absolute data confidentiality and operational transparency.
	•	Ethical Considerations and Professional Responsibility:
Brazilian legal ethics rules demand clear boundaries on AI-generated documents. Lexun should transparently declare its outputs as AI-assisted, with clear recommendations for attorneys to verify, validate, and assume final responsibility for produced legal documents. The ethical responsibility of legal advice always remains with the practicing attorney, reinforcing the importance of clear disclaimers and guidelines around AI-generated content.
	•	Document Retention and Legal Admissibility:
Brazilian courts impose specific requirements concerning document authenticity and admissibility in electronic formats. Lexun must ensure that generated documents comply with Brazilian regulations regarding electronic signatures, timestamping, digital authenticity, and document integrity, maintaining legal validity and enforceability in judicial and administrative procedures.

## Mitigation Strategy

Technical Mitigations

1. Inefficient Document Indexing (OCR and Data Cleaning)
	•	Implement automated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines for digitizing and accurately indexing non-digital documents. Partner with specialized OCR providers (e.g., Amazon Textract) to continuously improve text extraction accuracy.
	•	Develop clear documentation and user-friendly onboarding tools encouraging standardization of metadata, naming conventions, and document classification before integration, simplifying indexing and retrieval.

2. Challenges in Document Segmentation (“Chunking”)
	•	Adopt a dynamic, intelligent chunking approach based on document type, length, and legal relevance rather than static-size segments. This adaptive method preserves context, reduces information loss, and optimizes retrieval accuracy.
	•	Regularly assess retrieval accuracy through controlled tests and continuous feedback from legal experts, adjusting chunk parameters iteratively to improve the AI’s contextual comprehension.

3. Vector Database Scalability and Cost
	•	Leverage scalable and cost-efficient vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, AWS OpenSearch) designed specifically for embedding storage and semantic retrieval.
	•	Optimize database architecture and retrieval algorithms, ensuring low latency and manageable costs even with large datasets. Consider hybrid indexing methods (e.g., sparse and dense retrieval) to balance speed, accuracy, and scalability.

3. Risk of AI “Hallucinations” (Incorrect References)
	•	Prioritize transparency by clearly displaying the original document references alongside AI-generated outputs, allowing easy human verification.
	•	Incorporate “Human-in-the-loop” validation mechanisms, enabling lawyers to review AI-generated documents before finalization, with built-in annotation or commenting functionalities for continuous feedback and retraining.

4. Integration Complexity with Existing Systems
	•	Offer pre-built integrations (connectors and APIs) with popular document storage solutions (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, SharePoint, iManage) to minimize friction and ensure compatibility.
	•	Provide dedicated support and customizable onboarding assistance for large clients, ensuring smooth integration into their existing technology ecosystems and workflows.

## Legal and Regulatory Mitigations

3. Legal Admissibility and Document Integrity
	•	Align document generation and management practices with Brazilian regulations on digital signatures, timestamping, and authenticity verification to ensure legal admissibility in court and compliance with procedural standards.
	•	Implement immutable audit trails and robust version-control systems that enable tracking and validation of document integrity and authenticity at any point in time.

3. Ethical and Professional Responsibility Concerns
	•	Clearly communicate to users the role and limitations of the AI solution. Reinforce that Lexun is a decision-support tool rather than a substitute for professional judgment.
	•	Integrate human oversight into critical stages of document generation and ensure lawyers remain responsible for the final review and approval, reinforcing professional accountability and ethical compliance.

4. Ensuring Reliability (Avoiding AI “Hallucinations”)
	•	Utilize RAG precisely to ensure that generated content always references verified internal or external legal sources, displaying citations explicitly to reinforce trust and accuracy.
	•	Continuously retrain models using feedback loops from expert legal users to quickly identify and correct any inaccuracies or performance issues.
