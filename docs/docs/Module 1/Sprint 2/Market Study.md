## 1. Solution Overview

We propose an **advanced AI legal platform** with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, allowing law firms and legal professionals to integrate **both external legal sources** (legislation, jurisprudence) and **their own internal documents** (templates, past filings, internal memoranda). By indexing and retrieving internal materials, the AI can quickly generate contextually relevant drafts, insights, and references, saving time and enhancing consistency across a firm’s legal outputs.

## 2. Target Market

### a) Primary Focus:

**Law Firms (Small, Medium, Large)**

-  _Small and Solo Practitioners:_ Typically store documents in basic cloud services (Google Drive, OneDrive) or local systems. They need a cost-effective way to reuse their own models and quickly draft repetitive documents.
-  _Medium-Sized Firms:_ Often use specialized legal management software (e.g., Projuris, SAJ ADV) with a moderate level of digital organization. They require AI to accelerate repetitive tasks (litigation documents, client contracts) and ensure better document retrieval.
-  _Large Firms and BigLaw:_ Employ sophisticated DMS (Document Management Systems) such as iManage or SharePoint. They handle extensive document volumes and seek advanced AI to streamline drafting, reduce manual searches, and guarantee uniformity in legal arguments.

### b) Secondary Focus:

- **In-House Legal Departments (Corporations):** Where teams manage a large volume of contracts, compliance checks, and internal policies. They need AI-driven search across corporate data plus quick, customized drafting of internal memos and legal reports.
- **Government/Regulatory Bodies:** Some interest here if the AI can help manage large archives of administrative documents, though procurement cycles can be long.

Overall, the solution targets **organizations that generate and reuse substantial volumes of legal documents**, needing to reference both published legal sources and proprietary files.

## 3. Market Measurement and Estimation

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

-  **Number of Legal Professionals in Brasil:** Over 1.3 million lawyers are registered with the Brazilian Bar Association (OAB). Roughly 60-70% of these operate as solo or small-practice attorneys. Medium and large law firms collectively employ tens of thousands more, forming the core professional user base.
-  **Corporate Legal Departments:** 96% of Brazilian companies with over 100 employees have at least one lawyer or legal team. Many large corporations face repetitive contract work and regulatory demands, positioning them as strong prospects for advanced legal AI.

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

- Targeting law firms and in-house departments that are digitally capable and actively pursuing technology solutions. Based on tech adoption surveys among lawyers, approximately 30-40% of practitioners report using advanced legal software or plan to adopt AI tools. This subset is more open to solutions like RAG-based AI.
-  Estimated SAM within the next 1-2 years: **200,000–300,000 potential seats** across small/medium/large firms plus in-house teams (a conservative slice of the total, focusing on those with demonstrated interest in legaltech).

  

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Initial penetration strategy targets:

1.  **Small to Medium Practices**: Quick adoption via SaaS subscriptions (monthly plans, easy onboarding).

2.  **Enterprise-Level Firms**: Higher contract value through tailored deployments, data integrations, and premium support.

Combining these approaches, early projections suggest capturing **5-10%** of the SAM within 3 years by gradually expanding from early adopters to broader segments. This yields an approximate user base of **10,000–30,000 paying seats**, depending on pricing tiers and adoption rates.

  

### Validation Indicators

1.  **Existing Demand for Document Reuse**: Surveys show ~28% of lawyers rely heavily on existing document templates, indicating high interest in retrieval-based generation.

2.  **Rapid Growth in Brazilian LegalTech**: The local legaltech sector (law-related technology companies) has grown 300% in membership within AB2L (Brazilian Association of Lawtechs & Legaltechs) since 2017.

3.  **Case Studies**: Competing platforms focusing on AI-generated legal documents (e.g., copy-generation for litigation or contract drafting) have scaled to thousands of paying users within months. This momentum underpins potential uptake.

## **4. Conclusion**

### Market Definition

•  **Core**: Brazilian law firms (of all sizes) and in-house corporate legal departments needing to harness their internal documents for faster, more consistent drafting.

•  **Additional**: Potential later expansion to public sector (government legal bodies) or regional expansions in Latin America sharing similar legal structures.

### How It Was Measured

•  **Quantitative**: OAB-registered attorneys, adoption rates from lawtech surveys, corporate legal department data.

•  **Qualitative**: Interviews and anecdotal evidence pointing to heavy reliance on internal precedent documents, templates, and archived records.

•  **Competitive Benchmarking**: Growth of existing AI-assisted drafting tools confirms the market appetite.

By merging these data points, the solution’s addressable market covers a substantial segment of the Brazilian legal community—particularly those seeking to reuse firm-specific knowledge assets—and presents a clear trajectory for adoption through SaaS and enterprise tiers.
